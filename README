DATA FILES
	The following files may be used for writing by the web server and require manually providing write permissions:
	graphs/

bcbuy.php, bcsell.php
	These scripts require cron.getmarketdata.php to function properly

cron.php

	Uses PHP exec() function to execute a bash script.

cron.getmarketdata.php
	Make sure can use PHP exec() otherwise rewrite code to accomodate for this.
	Make sure web server has write access to files open in this script and rename paths accordingly if desired.
	This file provides the basis of functionality for all other market data related scripts.

	This file produces a data file used for charting flot/gnuplot graphs

getblockdata.sample
	This is a bash script.  Rename it to "getblockdata" so that the cron.php file can parse it.

	Remove the flot and gnuplot links as they are not useful yet until I have included them into this repository.
